Obsidian Conflict

Map: oc_cannon_1

Description:

You and your team of new recruits must complete the final stage of your training before you are sent to
the experimental weapons platform in deep space.

The facility you experience will be made up of a scan taken from your minds.


Try to avoid thinking during the brain scan process.


Good Luck!
