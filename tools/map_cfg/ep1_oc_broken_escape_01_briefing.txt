Description:

You are in a small group of citizens, who made it to a train to escape City 17,
but the train had to stop at an old trainstation, because parts of the roof collapsed
and the debris are blocking the rails.

Mission: The Citadel reactor is about to collapse, find a way out of the city, 
if you want to survive!
