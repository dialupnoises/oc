Description:

Cardwar is a map which features pvp gameplay in where each team selects up to 4 groups of npcs, represented by cards. Each round these npcs fight in a randomly selected arena. The winning team gets to choose between two randomly selected cards. The losing team gets a single randomly selected card.


To start playing, break the glass on the display to take your first card. Place it on one of the lineup panels, and press the "Ready" lever. Once the player(s) on the other team have done the same, the doors will open to the arena.
